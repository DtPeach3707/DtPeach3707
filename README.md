### Hi, I'm Dmitri Kalinin!

I am a young coder that uses Convolutional Machine Learning to do all sorts of projects, which include:
 - A Mario Kart DS DRL Agent that uses PIL's Screencapture for inputs and a Lua Script to reward it
 - Multiple ML networks involving my two cats (GANS, CNNs, detectors)
 - Card GANs
 - Using blob detection to track the position of a magnetic pendulum

I wish to do more projects which involve using ML to gain insight into physical phenomena, like the magnetic pendulum project I did.

Code Projects I am currently working on:
 - Another DRL project
 - A Raspberry Pi ML Project
