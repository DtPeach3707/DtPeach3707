### Hi, I'm Dmitri K.!

I am a young coder (mostly using Python) that uses Convolutional Machine Learning to do all sorts of projects, which include:
 - A Mario Kart DS DRL Agent that uses PIL's screenshot function (Imagegrab.grab()) for inputs and a Lua Script to reward it
 - Multiple ML networks involving my two cats (GANs, CNNs, detectors)
 - Card GANs
 - Using blob detection to track the position of a magnetic pendulum
 - A Raspberry Pi ML projects that uses sockets to get a computer to train a CNN to detect the angle of a servo and send it to the RPi to mimic it. 

I wish to do more projects which involve using ML to gain insight into physical phenomena, like the magnetic pendulum project I did.

Code Project(s) I am currently working on:
 - Another DRL project
 - Dabbling into Quantum Machine Learning (not really a project yet but I'm exploring it because it's something I'm interested in)
