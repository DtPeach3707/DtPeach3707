### Hi, I'm Dmitri K.!

I am a Georgia Tech student who mainly uses Python and JavaScript. Projects of mine include:
 - A Mario Kart DS DRL Agent that uses PIL's screenshot function (Imagegrab.grab()) for inputs and a Lua Script to reward it
 - DRL Agents to play Connect 4
 - Multiple ML networks involving my two cats (GANs, CNNs, detectors)
 - Card GANs
 - Using blob detection to track the position of a magnetic pendulum
 - A Raspberry Pi ML project that uses sockets to get a computer to train a CNN to detect the angle of a servo and send it to the RPi to mimic it. 
 - Various Chrome/Firefox web extensions

I wish to do more projects which involve using ML to gain insight into physical phenomena, like the magnetic pendulum project I did.
