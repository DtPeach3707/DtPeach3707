### Hi, I'm Dmitri K.!

I am a young coder (mostly using Python) that mainly uses Convolutional Machine Learning and other image processing code to do all sorts of projects, which include:
 - A Mario Kart DS DRL Agent that uses PIL's screenshot function (Imagegrab.grab()) for inputs and a Lua Script to reward it
 - DRL Agents to play Connect 4
 - Multiple ML networks involving my two cats (GANs, CNNs, detectors)
 - Card GANs
 - Using blob detection to track the position of a magnetic pendulum
 - A Raspberry Pi ML project that uses sockets to get a computer to train a CNN to detect the angle of a servo and send it to the RPi to mimic it. 

I wish to do more projects which involve using ML to gain insight into physical phenomena, like the magnetic pendulum project I did.

There are few code projects that I have in the works, and even more ideas for future projects that I want to do! As such, I am trying to keep this page as up-to-date regarding projects I have completed as I can.
